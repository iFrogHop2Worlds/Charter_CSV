# CharterCsv
Lets you easily load or create csv files and visualize the data with charts.

You can generate a default chart for fast easy results. Or use our in house developed csv query language
called csvqb to create fine-tuned data analysis via the aggregate, math, logical operators.

csvqb is being developed with this project and is not yet complete.
csvqb uses a hybrid infix notation to construct operation pipelines. Operations are performed
on a 2dVector representation of the csv files. 

# Features
- Upload, create, edit, unload csv files
- generate default graphs
- construct complex queries (csvqb)
- export graphs

Not all these features are implemented yet. Will update this and add docs once the feature list is completed.


In the future we will add Ai to use natural language to construct queries making it easier for some.
